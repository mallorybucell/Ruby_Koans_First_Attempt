# Ruby_Koans_First_Attempt

First attempt at the koans. Was a bit overwhelmed as this was during my first week or two at the IronYard, and my first programming language, but I definitely learned a lot.  

I plan on going back and doing them again, with more time to meditate and with more context to understand what is going on.
